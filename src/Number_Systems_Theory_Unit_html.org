  1.2.4 Operations on Numbers Let us consider the basic arithmetic
  operations such as addition and multiplication. In the case of
  addition using the Hindu system, we have the notion of a carry so that
  if the sum of any two digits in a position with weight of 10k will
  create a carry of 1 with a weight of 10 k+1\. The same is concept
  holds true for positional systems such as the binary system, with the
  only difference being the weights. In the unary system, the addition
  of numbers x and y will result in a number with x + y I¡äs.Addition in
  the Roman system is much more complicated. To add two numbers in the
  Roman system,one starts by writing the numbers side by side. For
  example, to add 32 and 53, write XXXII and LIII side by side as XXXII
  LIII. Then, arrange these letters so that the numerals are in
  decreasing order. We get:LXXXIIIII. The five Is can be simplified by
  writing them as V. So we get LXXXV. This process is continued till no
  simplification is possible. Care has to be taken when adding numbers
  such as 64, written as LXIV.Similar observations hold in the case of
  multiplication as multiplication can be treated as repeated addition
  in its basic form. So one way to multiply Roman numbers is to multiply
  the larger number by the smaller number. For example, to multiply 123
  by 52, we start by writing the numbers as CXXIII and LII. Now,
  multiply the larger number CXIII by L. This is done by first
  multiplying by 10, which means promoting the symbols and then
  duplicating each symbol five times. Simplification can be done to
  reduce the number to the standard form. Then,multiplication by 2 is
  simply duplicating each symbol twice. Simplifying, we get the
  answer. The above reading suggests that the method of number
  representation does have a bearing on the ease of the
  operation. Hence, even with simple operations such as addition and
  multiplication, a better way to organize data helps in performing the
  operation efficiently. In the rest of this chapter, we will use the
  decimal/binary system. We will carry forward this lesson to other
  operations.
